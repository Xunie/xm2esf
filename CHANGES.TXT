xm2esf changelog                    MM-DD-YYYY

== <xm2esf 1.1 Beta 2> ============ 08-06-2015
- Fixed broken volume slides (esp. on PSG)
  I made completely wrong assumptions about how volslides work. They just add/deduct the value every tick except
  for the first one. I made a complete mess of it and thought it was much, much more complicated :P

  Especially *upward* slides were broken in 1.1b.

  Eh, whatever volume slides work 100% properly for the first time ever!!
- !! XM to FM volume forumla is now 100% accurate

  Super-special thanks to Tiido (TmEE) for the formula!!!

- Fixed pitch related effects not carrying on after empty rows inbetween... again.
- Lots of code cleanup
- Fixed PSG Noise modes being reversed...
- Added support for fine volume slides.

  Sorry, I can't upload the bugfixed xm2esfgui yet because I seem to have lost the source code... :X
  (To the bugfixed version I mean. Don't remember what exactly I fixed, but there were plenty of things)

== <xm2esf 1.1 Beta> ============== 12-04-2014
- Temporary preliminary code to support the volume column. This is very very unsafe and
  probably best left to a night where I'm very, very bored ...

== <xm2esf 1.00 RC7> ============== 03-30-2014
- Added the capability of having a sync channel. In conjunction with a special echo version,
  this would trigger a flag in Z80 memory when a note off was played on it, which can be used 
  to sync a game or demo to the music.
  This feature was used in 'overdrive' by Titan.
- Partially reverted the broken volume slide behavior from RC6. 
- Fixed a few xm2esfgui bugs. 

== <xm2esf 1.00 RC6> ============== 10-20-2012
- Converted duplicate frequency functions to casted copies
- Fixed volume function inaccuracy in which they assumed the range was 0-63 when it is actually 0-64
- Introduced two command line switches which enable envelope triggering when the instrument column
  on a PSG channel isn't empty. Particularily applicable in the scenario when using a Portamento. 
  In the XM, something like [C-5 12 -- 304] would retrigger instrument 12's volume envelope. 
  In xm2esf that wasn't handled. It's still not handled by default, but the switches -r and -p allow it now.
  Only applicable to PSG, obviously. 
- Minor little fixes and tweaks
- Changed volume slide behavior
- Several instances of writing notes and frequencies converted to macros
                              
== <xm2esf 1.00 RC3> ============== 10-02-2012

- Fixed an issue with the wrong or uninitialized note data as base on portamentos with note-on on the same row
- added license
- Fixed major crash, hang and memory corruption issue, potentially crashing the OS, producing garbled output, etc

! Compiler changed to FreeBASIC 0.24
! Linux version added for xm2esf, loadxm and esfopt

(xm2esfgui for linux coming soon)

== <xm2esf 1.00 RC2> ============== 09-28-2012

- Fixed Portamento up / down
- Fixed new notes not triggereing when effects 1xx and 2xx are on the same row 
- Fixed reset volume on note-on
- Fixed conditions for resetting volume on note-on
- Fixed current note value getting updated for 2xx but not 1xx
- Fixed terrible mistakes in portamento 3xx code..... 
  The checks weren't working, the conditions were wrong, 
  I'm surprised portamentos even worked in the first place
- Removed silly hacks 
- Fixed portamentos incorrectly carrying on from a non-slide effect (like arpeggio, vibrato, etc.), 
  taking previous, perhaps uninitialized data as base note
- Fixed program hangs after conversion
- Fixed volume slide effect value actually being ignored
- Fixed volume slide behavior
- Optimized Arpeggio code
- Optimized and fusioned portamento code
- New note code optimized a bit
- Remember & reload instruments when looping
- Fixed pitch related effects not carrying on after empty rows inbetween
- PSG frequencies get initialized by generating them on the fly, instead of loading from an external file
