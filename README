------------------------

usage: xm2esf <infile> <outfile> -<switches>

<infile>  is an XIF file. An XIF file is a descriptor
          file that contains all the parameters which xm2esf will
          respect while creating the resulting ESF file, and also the
          path and filename to the input XM file.

          Creating an XIF file is possible using the bundled xm2esfgui
          It is very easy to use and creates a XIF file
          that is perfectly parseable by xm2esf :)

          http://segaretro.org/Echo

<outfile> is the output path ad filename xm2esf will use to create
          the resulting ESF file. Please note that if this file exists
          it WILL BE OVERWRITTEN, even if you encounter a bug and the
          conversion somehow fails.

Switches:

-p        Retrigger volume envelope on PSG channel when the instrument column
          is filled when there is one of the standard portamento/vibrato
          effects playing. (1xx, 2xx, 3xx and 4xx)
-r        Like -p, except it triggers regardless of the effect column's
          content
-i		  Ignore Note-Offs on PSG channels
Bye :D!
